## What is HaPyLi?

HaPyLi is a programming language designed to compile to
[Whitespace](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php). Its syntax was
derived from <u>Ha</u>skell, <u>Py</u>thon, and <u>Li</u>sp, hence the name. I
created it partly to learn more about text parsers, regular expressions,
compilers, Haskell, and Python (it was originally written in Haskell, but that
language felt too clunky. I haven't yet mastered proper abstraction in
functional languages).

[Download the HaPyLi compiler](./HaPyLi.7z)
(requires Python v2.5).

## Umm... what the hell? Why?

Have you ever been told by your boss to look busy, even though there were no
projects for you to do? Now imagine being told that, roughly every day, for two
years. That's what it's like to be a programmer for a certain United States
government agency. HaPyLi is the end result of my "looking busy". Yes, I'm very
glad to be out of there!
